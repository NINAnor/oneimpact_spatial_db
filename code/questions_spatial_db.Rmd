## Landscape variables

- **Variables**: land use/cover classes, elevation and derived (slope, aspect, TPI, TPI density)

- Where should I get the elevation (dem, slope, aspect) from? g_Elevation_Fenoscandia?

- g_Elevation_Fenoscandia_TPI: all maps with 50m. Should I resample them to 100m?
Should I calculate it for more window sizes? so far, 250, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000, 10000

- How to match land use classes from maps from Sweden and Norway? 
Or should we use a single map for the whole region (a regional or Europe land use map)?

- Define the issue above before running density maps for land use
